# Rapoo KX keyboard profile for Karabiner
So you just got a Rapoo KX to use with your Mac because it's a nice mechanical keyboard that comes at a pretty low cost and all. Nice!

If, like me, you're dissatisfied with the default layout and the difficulty to customize the F keys, read on.

[Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) is the best tool for remapping input, hands down. This personal configuration (private.xml under Preferences > Misc & Uninstall > Custom Settings) gives you the following options:

1. Change the [Application] and [Up Arrow] on the right side into a [Shift] when you hold them down
2. Swap the [Win] and [Alt] buttons on either side
2. Set [F1] / [F2] to Brightness control
3. Set [F3] to Expos√©
4. Set [F4] - [F9] to media and volume controls, as per labelled on the KX
5. Set right side [Ctrl] to [Fn], which is otherwise missing from the KX
